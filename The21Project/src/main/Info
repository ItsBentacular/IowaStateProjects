My second big project at ISU as a freshman. Made using Java/JavaFX, it is me and a group of 3 others' attempt at blackjack using only Java and its addons.
While it is uncompiled, if compiled using maven and javaFX, it does function, and is a pretty good representation of blackjack. All of the art is Handmade using piskel pixel editor.
Credits to: Ethan Cyzon, Grayson Burton, and Robin Lin for working with me on this project.
